That's terrific. I did have to make some small changes to get it to run:

- At the bottom of task.js, I had to add: export default Task;
- I had to add a file, index.tsx, attached.

Going forward, I have also:
- I removed the makeObserverCallback method from the Group model, as it is not being used.
- I changed the properties "label" and "text" to be "name" and "description".
Attached is a new version models.js.

Please make these changes to the React Native version that you have made.
